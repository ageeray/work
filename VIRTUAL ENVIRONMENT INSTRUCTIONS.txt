virtual environment creation/recreation instructions for Anaconda


To use these files to create an identical environment run this in cmd propmt:
conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

To use the spec files to install its listed packages into an already existing environment, run this in cmd prompt:
conda install --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

Example:
conda create --name testVenv --file "\\centerstone.lan\ent\GroupDrive\Angus_Shared\Python Projects\Virtual Environment Files\BaseVenvSpec-file.txt"




How to create these spec files:
open up cmd then change to what directory you want the txt file in
(pushd \\centerstone.lan\ent\GroupDr... to changed directory to mapped drive )

activate which virtual environment you want to export the module settings.  (in windows: "activate VenvName")

then run:
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt

(to get out of an activated Venv, just type "deactivate" in cmd)

Done!
